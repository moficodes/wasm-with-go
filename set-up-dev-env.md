# Setup

In this section we will setup the necessary tools needed to run Wasm examples.

## Requirements

* [Go 1.13+](https://go.dev/doc/install) (At the time of writing, default go version is 1.19)
* Some text editor. The instruction uses [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Any supported browser (Latest version of Chrome, Firefox or Safary should do)

This is all we need to get started. In the next section we will write our first WebAssebly Application.
